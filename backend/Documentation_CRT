------------------------------

08.05.25
- Created and finished .env file
- Created and finished .gitignore file
- Finished config.py

Specifications:

.env and .gitignore:
- Sensitive values are put into ".env" (Environment Variables) file, which is added to ".gitignore" so they never land in version control and stay secret
- CORS needed because FastAPI uses localhost:8000, but Next.js uses localhost:3000
- SECRET_KEY is for signatures and validating/verifying the token

app/core/config.py:
- Centralizes and validates all of the configuration
- Defines what settings the app needs, their types and where to load them from (.env)
- So that other modules can just use "from app.core.config import settings" and then "settings.DATABASE_URL" or "settings.SECRET_KEY"...
